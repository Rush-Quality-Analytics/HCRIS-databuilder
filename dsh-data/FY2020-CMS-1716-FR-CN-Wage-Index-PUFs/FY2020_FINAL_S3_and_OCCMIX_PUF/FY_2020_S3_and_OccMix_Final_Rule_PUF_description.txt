As of June 26, 2019, the hospitals' occupational mix data are ""deleted"" from the FY 2020 wage index for 2 possible reasons: 1) the hospital's Worksheet S-3 wage data is ""deleted"" from the FY 20 Final S-3 Data PUF tab, and therefore, its occupational mix data cannot be included in the wage index without accompanying S-3 wage data, or 2) the hospital's Worksheet S-3 wage data is included in the FY 2020 wage index on the FY 20 Final S-3 Data PUF tab, but its occupational mix data is aberrant.
