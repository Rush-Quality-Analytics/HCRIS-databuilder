"Definitions"
"*Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH)* adjustment payments provide additional help to those hospitals that serve a significantly disproportionate number of low-income patients; eligible hospitals are referred to as DSH hospitals. States receive an annual DSH allotment to cover the costs of DSH hospitals that provide care to low-income patients that are not paid by other payers, such as Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) or other health insurance. This annual allotment is calculated by law and includes requirements to ensure that the DSH payments to individual DSH hospitals are not higher than these actual uncompensated costs."
""
"*Federal Fiscal Year*: Unless otherwise noted, years preceded by ""FY"" on statehealthfacts.org refer to the Federal Fiscal Year, which runs from October 1 through September 30. For example, FY 2018 refers to the period from October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018."
